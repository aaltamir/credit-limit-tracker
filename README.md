## Why?
 
We are interested in your skills as a developer. As part of our assessment, we want to see your code.
 
## Instructions
 
In this archive, you'll find two files, Workbook2.csv and Workbook2.prn, which need to be displayed by the software you deliver in HTML format.  
The output should be served by a web server. No particular html style is required. Please consider your work as a proof of concept for a system that can keep track of credit limits from several sources.

 
This repository is created specially for you, so you can push anything you like. Please update this README to provide instructions, notes and/or comments for us.
 
## The Constraints
 
The solution has to be implemented in Java and we expect this to be done within a week.
 
## Questions?
 
If you have any questions please ask dl-ecg-technical-assessment@ebay.com.
 
## Finished?

Make sure the steps to run the solution are provided in the Readme.  
Then, please send an email to dl-ecg-technical-assessment@ebay.com to let us know you're done.
 
Have fun!
